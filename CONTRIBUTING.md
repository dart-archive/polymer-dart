# How to contribute

### Send patches to the Dart repo

We are currently in the middle of a migration process. Polymer.dart is still
developed under the Dart repo in `branches/bleeding_edge/dart/pkg/polymer/`.
Until the migration is complete, we are not accepting pull requests on this
repo.

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Even for small changes, we ask that you please sign the CLA electronically
[here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
The CLA is necessary because you own the copyright to your changes, even
after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission
to use and distribute your code. You can find more details
[here](https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/Contributing).
